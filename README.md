#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
<p>The purpose of this project was to identify the dependence of the strength of concrete on its composition and production technology, using the results of the tests. It was necessary to build a machine learning model that implements this approach.</p> <p>The successful solution of such problems can significantly reduce costs and accelerate the production of a quality product.</p>

### Methods Used
* Data preparation
* Exploratory analysis
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning

## Project Description
<p>As data, two files are given that contain a training and a test sample. The training sample consists of ten columns. The first is the composition identifier (data points), the next eight are independent variables, and the ninth (last) is the target that the model should predict.</p> <p>The test sample consists of nine columns â€” the same as in the training one, but without the target variable.</p>
<p>Solutions are evaluated by the value of the root-mean-square error.</p>
